# Historically Important Software Projects

_Knowing where we came from helps us understand where we are going..._ 

While Github searches and indexes typically focus on the 'hottest' and most popular projects, at the moment, many projects are historically interesting from programming, architecture, and project management perspectives.  This site maintains a list of repositories, code archives, and organizations where readers can find historically important projects.  

Also, we include articles that reference, analyze, and explain these projects.  Some of the projects are forked, to the [Research Project](https://github.com/IMTorgRsrchProj) organization, unless license agreements prevent it, or they are actively maintained.  Additionally, data collected from these projects, and others, can be found in the  [Research Project Data](https://github.com/IMTorgRsrchProjData) organization.

This efforts hopes to build on similar work, such as [AOSA](http://aosabook.org) in broadening readers' experiences across many different systems.  The long-term goal of this project is to be able to analyze the code and project history in order to learn from them, empirically.  Questions of interest include, what characteristics allow:
* maturation
* scalability
* high quality
* etc. 

__FAQ__
* Why not just search for Github repos with the most commits?  Because many of the oldest projects are ported to git, or there license does not permit storage in Github.
* What qualities constitute a historically-important project?  While some are still going strong, other important projects reached their zenith years ago.  As time progresses, hopefully, definitive rules will be gleaned for what is historically-important.

Please feel free to contribute and let others know of an important and even moderately old project, or explanation of one.
